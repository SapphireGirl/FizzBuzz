## Requirements
 
#### Part 2:

Write an MVC controller class with two methods. 
One that returns a view with a collection of objects, 
and a second that performs an add or update of the same type 
as the first method. 
Please use attribute routing to decorate the methods 
and should indicate an appropriate method type.

The class used for the collection of objects should 
include an identifier property, and 2 or 3 other properties, 
which includes at least 1 string and 1 integer. 
For example: ID, First Name, Last Name & Age.
